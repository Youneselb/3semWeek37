[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Youneselb/3semWeek37.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Youneselb/3semWeek37)

Genereal status:
Project could not be deployed to : https://younes.club, because of subbranch problem in Github, that I tried to work around, 
by changing folders and so on, which started giving me build problems in netbeans (might have messed som packaging). But code and all tests were working before that (as can be observed). 

But earlier projects have been deplyoed (https://younes.club/Monitor/), so the procedure is known. 

Travis build fail, because of mistakes in .travis.yml file, that I could not fix. https://travis-ci.com/github/Youneselb/3semWeek37 .

Monday: Travis has been set up. See Tuesday for REST,JPA, Test and CI with start code excersie.

Tueday: Completed. Project was ready for deploy and all tests passed. Build in Netbeans started giving problems,
beause of issues with subbranch, and trying to work around it, which apparently messed some things up???

Travis building failed, because of mistakes in .travis.yml file, that I could not fix. 

Wednesday: JavaScript Array and day 3 excercises complete.

Thursday/Friday: Not finished completely, reached halfway. JavaScript still very new and little exposure :)
